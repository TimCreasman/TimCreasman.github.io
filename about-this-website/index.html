  <div class="post-content"><blockquote>
<p>For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.</p>
<p>&ndash; Colossians 1:16</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="made-to-create">Made to Create</h2>
<p>I wanted a place where I could not only blog about my life and my God, but also archive and chronicle the various carpentry projects, musical compositions, and apps I have created and will hopefully continue to create. This is a creative outlet as much as it is a technical outlook on life.</p>
<p>Ultimately I want this website to be a place of divinely inspired creativity, as I believe we are created in the image of a creative God. Like Him, we too desire to build, compose, and construct - adding our own touch to the world around us.</p>
<h2 id="made-to-share">Made to Share</h2>
<p>In addition to creating, we also have an innate desire to throw our creations out into the world. This is simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating. To be honest, this is only a secondary priority for me. If no one ever saw this website it would still exist and I would still go on creating. Yet, sharing creations inspires others to create. This whole website&rsquo;s existence would be fulfilled if even one person saw a post of mine and was inspired to create something of their own.</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, I hope future employers, friends, and family members alike will enjoy this website and perhaps gain an ounce of desire to pickup a creative skill themselves.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-website-was-made">How this Website was Made</h2>
<p>This website is built using the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a> framework. It was super simple to setup yet still easy to change the underlying guts of this website.</p>
<p>Highly recommend - 10/10 would build a website with HUGO again.</p>
