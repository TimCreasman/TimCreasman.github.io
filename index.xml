      <description>Welcome to My Website Made to Create I wanted a place where I could not only blog about my life and my God, but also archive and chronicle the various carpentry projects, musical compositions, and apps I have created and will hopefully continue to create. This is a creative outlet as much as it is a technical outlook on life.
Ultimately I want this website to be a place of divinely inspired creativity, as I believe we are created in the image of a creative God.</description>
