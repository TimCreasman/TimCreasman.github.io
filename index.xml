      <description>Overview In this post I will be discussing the SnackTracker project that was worked on in 2017 (my third summer at PointSource). At a high-level, SnackTracker was a fullstack IoT system that incorporated software and hardware into a seamless experience. NOTE this is a very high level look at the project as a whole and I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into too much detail (I would hate to bore you&amp;hellip;). If you love details feel free to email me any questions or requests at timcreasmanwebsite@gmail.</description>
