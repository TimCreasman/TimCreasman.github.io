<h2 id="welcome-to-my-website">Welcome to My Website</h2>

<h3 id="made-to-create">Made to Create</h3>

<p>I wanted a place where I could not only blog about my life and my God, but also archive and chronicle the various carpentry projects, musical compositions, and apps I have created and will hopefully continue to create. This is a creative outlet as much as it is a technical outlook on life.</p>

<p>Ultimately I want this website to be a place of divinely inspired creativity, as I believe we are created in the image of a creative God. Like Him, we too desire to build, compose, and construct - adding our own touch to the world around us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ultimately I want this website to be a place of divinely inspired creativity.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="made-to-share">Made to Share</h3>

<p>In addition to creating, we also have an innate desire to throw our creations out into the world. This is simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating. To be honest, this is only a secondary priority for me. If no one ever saw this website it would still exist and I would still go on creating. Yet, sharing creations inspires others to create. This whole website&rsquo;s existence would be fulfilled if even one person saw a post of mine and was inspired to create something of their own.</p>

<p>In addition to all of this, I hope future employers, friends, and family members alike will enjoy this website and perhaps gain an ounce of desire to pickup a creative skill.</p>
